This is a Java program that asks the user to input their name, age, class, state, and gender.
It then prints out the information provided by the user and identifies whether the user is male or female based on the gender input.

The program also uses a switch statement to determine which region of India the user is from based on the state input.
The program only includes a few states from each region for demonstration purposes.

Overall, the program serves as an example of how to receive user input, perform simple conditionals, and utilize switch statements in Java.![Blank diagram (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118505212/235296771-c68320ba-270e-4668-9884-cf419efea3db.png)
