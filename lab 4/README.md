The Java program is a menu-driven program that simulates banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, transaction history, and account summary.

The program has four global variables - accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance, and transaction. It has five functions - initialize, deposit, withdraw, transactions, and summary.

The initialize function initializes the customer by taking in the account number, account holder name, and initial account balance. It also initializes the transaction variable to an empty string.

The deposit function adds the deposited amount to the account balance and appends the transaction history with the deposited amount.

The withdraw function subtracts the withdrawn amount from the account balance if the balance is greater than the withdrawn amount. Otherwise, it displays an error message. It also appends the transaction history with the withdrawn amount.

The transactions function prints the transaction history.

The summary function prints the account holder name, account number, and transaction history.

The main function takes input from the user to initialize the customer and displays a menu with the following options - deposit money, withdraw money, print transactions, and print account summary. Based on the user's input, it calls the corresponding function to perform the desired operation.

The program continues to display the menu until the user enters 0 to exit.
