This question is asking you to work with the well-known iris dataset and calculate some summary statistics for its different attributes. Specifically, you need to find the mean, median, mode, minimum, and maximum values for four different attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, and PetalWidthCm.

Once you've calculated these overall summary statistics, you then need to identify the summary statistics for each of the three different species of iris flower in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
