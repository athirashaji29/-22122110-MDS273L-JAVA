Question -
Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.

The task is to write a Java program that takes an integer array as input from the user and then provides a menu of three different operations that can be performed on the array: calculating the mean value, calculating the median value, and calculating the mode value. The program should have at least three functions in addition to the main function, one for each of the three calculations, which should take the integer array as input and return the corresponding result. The program should display the result to the user from the main function. The mean value is calculated by adding up all the values in the array and dividing by the number of elements in the array. The median value is the middle value in the array, or the average of the two middle values if the array has an even number of elements. The mode value is the most commonly occurring value in the array.
