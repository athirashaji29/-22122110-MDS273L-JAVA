here i done a Java Program that will collect your basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the user is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into four different regions (North, South, East, and West). If you are from the southern part of India; with the help of a switch statement, it should display The Student is from the southern states of India", along with the basic details.

The code is a Java program that implements a simple menu-driven program to manage a list of names. The program starts by initializing an array of strings called "names" with a size of 1024. Then, a do-while loop is used to present the user with a menu of five options:

Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name
Show all names
Exit
The user is prompted to enter an option. The program then uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding action for the selected option. For example, if the user selects option 1, the program will prompt the user to enter a new name. It will then check if the name already exists in the list and if it doesn't, the name will be added to the list.

If the user selects option 2, the program will prompt the user to enter a name to search for, then search the list of names and print a message indicating whether the name was found and its position in the list.

Option 3 allows the user to remove a name from the list by entering the name to be removed. Option 4 displays all the names currently in the list. Option 5 exits the program. The program will repeat until the user selects option 5.
