This is a programming task that requires you to write a Java program that reads a text file and extracts various information from its content. The program should be able to identify and count the occurrences of vowels and digits in the text file. Additionally, it should also find the top five and least five repeated words and characters in the text file.

To accomplish this task, you will need to use file handling in Java to read the contents of the text file. Then, you will need to implement string manipulation techniques to identify and count vowels, digits, words, and characters in the file. You will also need to use data structures such as arrays, lists, and maps to store and manipulate the data.

Here's an overview of the steps you may follow to solve this problem:

Create a Java program that takes the path of the text file as input.

Use Java's file handling API to read the content of the text file and store it in a string variable.

Implement string manipulation techniques to count the occurrences of vowels and digits in the text file.

Implement a function that finds the top five and least five repeated words in the text file. To accomplish this, you may need to split the text into words, store them in an array or list, and count their occurrences using a map.

Implement a function that finds the top five and least five repeated characters in the text file. To accomplish this, you may need to loop through the characters in the text, store them in an array or list, and count their occurrences using a map.

Print out the results of the above steps in the desired format, such as a map or an array with key-value pairs.
